# Koodin assignment

### Installation
Use the JavaScript package manager of your choice and install the dependencies.
  - for ex. with pnpm: `pnpm install`

To run the application execute: `pnpm dev`


### Motivation
I have prioritized implementing all the functionality from the requirements. I have not optimized any of my implementations 
as I thought that would be out of scope for this assignment. For ex: filtering by genre is visibly slow, but the optimal solution 
for this would happen on the API, not necessary in the front-end code.

When I created the Next.js project, it came with the dark theme and I went with it. It would be a good to implement a switch for changing it 
to light theme, but this also is out of scope for now.

I haven't written tests. 

Error handling could easily be improved.

My main focus was to create a fully functional flow, based on the requirements.
